# Introduction

In lots of projects it is required to have a authentication system, in order to authorize users to do some actions, and identify them for logging purposes. This is a critical security issue because an error in it cost money, trust, and privacy. Furthermore, it is very interesting for some parties to have a centralized authentication system shared for several services.

## Goals
The goal of the Auth service is to provide a clear, secure, and simple authentication interface and authorization manager. It is a TCP server that SHOULD provide a SSL connection, on which an user must be able to authenticate, and request access to a resource.

The Auth service does not intend to replace security check on the services that use it. It is an annular similar to the LDAP services, but using a much simpler query language.

## Services
The Auth service provides two mains features: The authentication of user and the permissions management of the resources, based on the access of a user.

## Users and permissions
The users are identified using a couple username and password.
They also belong to groups. Those groups have a list of permissions.
Those permissions are couples of resources and right.

## Terminology

In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
"SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
{{RFC2119}}.

- client: A TCP endpoint that connect to the Auth service.
server A TCP server that can receive connection from clients.
- auth-api:
- secure client: Client connected using SSL.
- secure server: Server using SSL.
- command: Query sent to the server by the client.
- response: Message returned after a query from the server to the client.
