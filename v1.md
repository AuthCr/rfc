# Introduction

## Terminology

In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
"SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
{{RFC2119}}.

- client: A TCP endpoint that MUST connect to the Auth service.
- server: A TCP endpoint that MUST receive connection from clients.
- secure client: A client connected using SSL.
- secure server: A server using SSL.
- query: Messages sent to the server by the client.
- reply: Messages returned after a query from the server to the client.

## Goals
Nowadays, it is very common to require an authentication system to develop a software.
It allows the software to identify users, authorize them to do some actions, and log it.
It is a critical security issue because any error in the authentication policy or implementation costs money, trust, and privacy.
Furthermore, it is very interesting for some parties to have a centralized authentication system shared for several services.

The goal of the Auth service is to provide a clear, secure, and simple authentication interface and authorization manager.
It is implemented with a TCP server that SHOULD provide a SSL connection, on which a user must be able to authenticate, and request access to a resource.

The Auth service does not intend to replace security check on the services that use it. It is an annular similar to the LDAP services, but using a much simpler query language and installation.

## Services
The Auth service provides two mains features: The authentication of user and the permissions management of the resources, based on the access of a user.

## Users and permissions
The users SHOULD BE identified using a couple username and password.
They MUST also belong to groups. Those groups MUST have a list of permissions.
A permission MUST be a couple of resource and right.

# Protocol Overview

## Syntax of the queries
Queries MUST follow the grammar defined bellow:

    WORD_ANY     = <any alphanumeric ASCII character> / "_" / "-"
    WORD         = WORD_ANY WORD_ANY *
    ANY          = <any unicode character>
    ANY_STR      = ANY ANY *
    SPACE        = <ASCII SP, space>

    OPTION       = WORD "=" WORD
    PARAMETERS   = ( WORD SPACE ) * ( ANY_STR ) ?
    QUERY_WORDS  = ( OPTION ) * WORD SPACE ( WORD SPACE / OPTION ) *
    QUERY        = QUERY_WORDS ( ":" PARAMETERS ) ?

    JSON         = <Json object, defined in RFC7159> / "\"" ANY_STR "\""
    SUCCESS      = "success"
    FAILURE      = "failure"
    SUCCESS_DATA = ( SPACE JSON ) ?
    FAILURE_DATA = ( SPACE ANY * ) ?
    REPLY        = ( SUCCESS SUCCESS_DATA / FAILURE FAILURE_DATA )

### Special characters

There are some special characters that MUST have a special behaviour in the server:

- `\*`: it MUST match with "any string". It is for the query `USER HAS ACCESS TO` and `USER GET PERM`. Example: if a path `/public*` is defined, `USER HAS ACCESS TO : user /public/any` must matches.
- `$`: it MUST match with "any word", with the same behaviour than `\*`
- `~`: it MUST be replaced with the username of the current authenticated user when matching queries. Example: `/public/~/\*` for the user "root" is equal to `/public/root/\*`.
- `\a`: it SHOULD be replaced with the username of the current authenticated user when writing the query.

### Options

Some operations can be parametrized via OPTIONS.
Options are defined by a couple `KEY=VALUE`.

#### COUNT

The option `COUNT` defines an amount of data to retreive.
The value of this option is a unsigned 64 bits number.

* Minimum: 0
* Maximum: 18446744073709551615
* Default: 100

Example: `USER LIST COUNT=1` to retreive one user maximum.

#### PAGE

The option `PAGE` defines an offset of data.
It is multiplicated with the option `COUNT` to find the first data to retreive.
The value of this operation is a unsigned 64 bits number.

* Minimum: 0
* Maximum: 18446744073709551615
* Default: 0

Example: `USER LIST PAGE=2 COUNT=10` to retreive maximum 10 users, beginning from the 21th.

## Queries

### Type of queries

There are 3 mains types of query: AUTH, USER, GROUP.
They begin with the associated word.
Other queries MAY be added to extend the language but they MUST NOT begin with AUTH, USER, or GROUP.

### Replies

The replies contain the word "success" or "failure", and MAY be followed by a json data.

There are 3 types replies possible:

1. Boolean: either "success" or "failure". A failure MAY not be an error of syntax or connection.
2. None: "success" or "failure". A failure MUST be an error of syntax or connection.
3. Specified: other replies MAY be a failure (like None) but the "success" reply is followed by more data.

### Failure

If the query fails, a string that describes the problem MAY also be added.
There are 3 reasons of failures:

1. The client is not connected (no AUTH query has been successful).
2. The query contains an error (missing `:` for example).
3. The client does not have the right permissions to execute the query.

### Success

If the query returns a success, it is sometimes followed by a Json object, for the read operations (such as USER LIST, etc.).

### Queries descriptions

Parameters CAN be optional or mandatory.
Optional parameters are written `<param>`.
Mandatory parameters are written `[param]`.

#### AUTH

Query: `AUTH`

Parameters: `<username> <password>`

Replies: Boolean

Example: `AUTH : root toor`

#### USER HAS ACCESS TO

Parameters: `<group> [perm] [resource]`

Replies: None

Description: Create a group, and/or add the resource to an existing group.

Example: `GROUP ADD : guest`

Example: `GROUP ADD : guest read /public*`

#### GROUP REMOVE

Query: `GROUP REMOVE`

Parameters: `<group> [resource]`

Replies: None

Description: It MUST delete all permissions of a group on a given resource or the one specified. A group with no permissions SHOULD NOT exist (nor any relation with such group).

# Permissions

Any connected user can send queries to the server, which MUST respond with "success" or "failure".
It might be a "failure" because the user might not have the correct rights on the server.

When the server receive a query from a connected user, it MUST verify if the user has access to this query.

We RECOMMEND to manage the permissions by verifying that the user has access to the resource equal to the query with "write".
Thus the server whould execute a operation very similar to "USER AS ACCESS TO : connected_user_name QUERY".
