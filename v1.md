--- abstract

This standard aims to create a secure and simple user authentication process and verification of her permissions on the resources of an organization.
It is similar to the LDAP in this context, but much simplier.

# Introduction

## Terminology

In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
"SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
{{RFC2119}}.

- client: A TCP endpoint that MUST connect to the Auth service.
- server: A TCP endpoint that MUST receive connection from clients.
- secure client: A client connected using SSL.
- secure server: A server using SSL.
- command: Query sent to the server by the client.
- response: Message returned after a query from the server to the client.

## Goals
In lots of projects it is required to have a authentication system, in order to authorize users to do some actions, and identify them for logging purposes. This is a critical security issue because an error in it cost money, trust, and privacy. Furthermore, it is very interesting for some parties to have a centralized authentication system shared for several services.

The goal of the Auth service is to provide a clear, secure, and simple authentication interface and authorization manager. It is a TCP server that SHOULD provide a SSL connection, on which an user must be able to authenticate, and request access to a resource.

The Auth service does not intend to replace security check on the services that use it. It is an annular similar to the LDAP services, but using a much simpler query language and installation.

## Services
The Auth service provides two mains features: The authentication of user and the permissions management of the resources, based on the access of a user.

## Users and permissions
The users SHOULD BE identified using a couple username and password.
They MUST also belong to groups. Those groups MUST have a list of permissions.
A permission MUST be a couple of resource and right.

# Protocol Overview

## Syntax of the commands
Commands MUST follow the grammar defined bellow:

    SEP           = ":"
    WORD_FIRST    = <any alphanumeric ASCII character>
    WORD_ANY      = WORD_FIRST / <ASCII US, unit separator, underscore> / "-"
    WORD          = WORD_FIRST WORD_ANY *
    ANY           = <any unicode character>
    ANY_STR       = ANY ANY *
    SPACE         = <ASCII SP, space>

    PARAMETERS    = ( WORD SPACE ) * ( ANY_STR ) ?
    COMMAND_WORDS = WORD SPACE ( WORD SPACE ) *
    COMMAND       = COMMAND_WORDS ( SEP PARAMETERS ) ?

    JSON          = <any JSON object, defined in RFC 7159 {{RFC7159}}> / "\"" ANY_STR "\""
    SUCCESS       = "success"
    FAILURE       = "failure"
    SUCCESS_DATA  = ( SPACE JSON ) ?
    FAILURE_DATA  = ( SPACE ANY * ) ?
    RESPONSE      = ( SUCCESS SUCCESS_DATA / FAILURE FAILURE_DATA )

### Special characters

There are some special characters that MUST have a special behaviour in the server:

- "\*": it MUST match with "any string". It is for the command "USER HAS ACCESS TO" and "USER GET PERM". Example: if a path "/public*" is defined, "USER HAS ACCESS TO : user /public/any" must matches.
- "$": it MUST match with "any word", with the same behaviour than "\*"
- "~": it MUST be replaced with the username of the current authenticated user when matching commands. Example: "/public/~/\*" for the user "root" is equal to "/public/root/\*".
- "\a": it SHOULD be replaced with the username of the current authenticated user when writing the command.

## Types of commands

There are 3 mains types of command: AUTH, USER, GROUP.
They begin with the associated word.
Other commands MAY be added to extend the language but they MUST NOT begin with AUTH, USER, or GROUP.

## Response data

### Failures

If the command fails, a string that describes the problem MAY also be added.
There is 3 reasons of failures:

1. The client is not connected (no AUTH command has been successful)
2. The command contains an error (missing : for example)
3. The command returns a boolean "success" or "failure"

### Success

If the command returns a success, it is sometimes followed by a Json object, for the read operations (such as USER LIST, etc.).

## Commands descriptions

In the responses, we only handle success data and boolean responses.
Failure MAY occurs in any response for the same reasons.

There are 3 responses possible:

1. Boolean: either "success" or "failure". A failure MAY not be an error of syntax or connection.
2. None: "success" or "failure". A failure MUST be an error of syntax or connection.
3. Specified: other responses MAY be a failure (like None) but the "success" response is followed by more data.

# Permissions

Any connected user can send commands to the server, which MUST respond with "success" or "failure". It might be a "failure" because the user might not have the correct rights on the server.

When the server receive a command from a connected user, it MUST verify if the user has access to this command.

We RECOMMEND to manage the permissions by verifying that the user has access to the resource equal to the command with "write". Thus the server whould execute a operation very similar to "USER AS ACCESS TO : connected_user_name COMMAND".
